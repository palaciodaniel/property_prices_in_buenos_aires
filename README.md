# Property Prices in Buenos Aires
This repository consists on a series of Jupyter Notebooks (each one involving a specific Step) where three datasets will be analyzed, joined and cleaned, with the objective of applying a Machine Learning model to them.

The three of them consist on observations about properties in Buenos Aires and different aspects of them, like their location, price, surface, and descriptions.
